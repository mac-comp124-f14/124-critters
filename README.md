Comp 124: Critters Lab
====

**Acknowledgement:** Paul Cantrell developed this lab, Shilad tweaked the Eye code.

Today's lab is a bit of silly fun in the name of practicing graphics programming.

**When you get started, do not fork this repository. Check out the master copy directly.**

This project provides a framework for building little critters that wander around the screen.
Take a look at BoxBot, RoundBug, and LLCoolJ as two examples, then create some new Critter subclasses of your own!
The code is written to automatically detect new critters.

I recommend beginning by copying and modifying one of the existing critters.
Flip through the book or look at the ACM javadoc online for ideas about other things you can do with the ACM graphics library.
I hope that every team will be able to finish at least one new critter of their own invention!

Once you have a new Critter **working**, push your changes.
(You may have to pull other people's changes first.)
At the end of class, we'll have a critter party on the projector.
